\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Ecole des mines de Douai}{September 2012 - Present}{Software Engineer, Robotics}{Douai, Nord-Pas-de-Calais}
\item I am in charge of the development of the project RoboShop (http://car.mines-douai.fr/RoboShop), a robotic system for aiding persons to navigate into unknown spaces. 
\item My responsibilities are planning, engineering, development and technologic report writing for the projects RoboShop and PhaROS (http://car.mines-douai.fr/PhaROS). 
\item PhaROS is a framework for developing robot solutions for Pharo Smalltalk on the robotic middleware ROS. 
\item The project RoboShop was presented in Picom and Vad Conext 2013 (Some content about http://car.mines-douai.fr/2013/11/roboshop-demo-16oct2013/) 
\item The project PhaROS is going to be presented in FOSDEM 2014, (https://fosdem.org/2014/) as PhaROS Towards Live Environments in Robotics in the Smalltalk devroom.
\item From this position i also contribute with the project TaskIT (http://smalltalkhub.com/\#!/~sbragagnolo/TaskIT), which is a project for managing parallelism and concurrence in a Pharo smalltalk environment, and it will be soon integrated as an enterprise solution for the language.
\item The used technologies for the robot side are: ROS, Pharo, C++, Python. For the graphical interface: Pharo, Seaside, Javascript+backbone.js + Underscore.js, html+css3
\item For the framework project we started to write a cook-book and the related documentation, the first one in latex format, and the second one in markdown format.

\begin{rSubsection}{Fanwards (http://www.fanwards.com/)}{November 2011 - August 2012}{Software engineer, gamification}{Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentine}
\item I am in charge of design and implementation of the web application Fanwards, front and backend. working with the CTO.
\item Using for front end heavy weight clients based on javascript technologies such as Backbone.js, jquery, underscore.js , mustache and for the view HTML5 and CSS3.
\item Using for the backend a Google App Engine (GAE) Server with Scala \& Java, Objectify for the mapping between objects and google's BigTable, Spring MVC and RestFul frameworks for routing and dispatching of exposed and scheduled behaviours.Finally twitter4j and facebookRest for interacting with social networks.  
\item From this position i have developed: a full intelligent single-page client based on javascript,  a small functional library for javascript implementing some of the common haskell features (partial application, curryfication and function compositions), really useful abstractions for AJAX request processing, also developed a social network crawler for analysing users comments for branding (with heuristics to analyse the meaning of each comment). 
\item From this position i also participate not just in software design, planning and architecture but also in the gamification process of the application.
\item During all the development of the application we used Scala BDD and TDD techniques with great success. 
\item You can watch the most important part of the implementation in the following example \url{https://www.facebook.com/pages/Melee-Island-Inc/252598398140724?id=252598398140724&sk=app_232320516837452}
